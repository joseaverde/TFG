Welch:
   Make that the square of the values using a 32 bit fixed point type with a
   result type of 64 bits:

   64_bit_type'(32_bit_type * 32_bit_type)

   Instead of

   64_bit_type'(64_bit_type * 64_bit_type)

   And see how it improves speed

Power Spectral Density:
 * DTW
 * Welch
 * Simpson
 * Fast Fourier Transform

Functions:
 * Square Root

Other things to note:
   Do simple benchmarking functions for each and every function that can be
   executed independently
